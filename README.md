# Ask.md

This is a quick implementation of how Yacine described Ask.md in his [stream](https://twitter.com/yacineMTB/status/1788633837108408815).

## Usage

- Set your Groq API key using the `Ask.md: Set Groq API Key` command.
- Configure keyboard shortcuts for the `Ask.md: LLM Basic Completion Request` and `Ask.md: LLM Advanced Completion Request` commands.
- Open a Markdown file and start typing.
- Enter your prompt and press the configured keyboard shortcut to send the request to the LLM.
